## **Project Title**
Covid-19 classification using CV with DL from Chest X-Ray images
## **Project Description**
We took a very recent paper, [DEEP-COVID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09363.pdf) by Minaee et al. as a baseline and do transfer learning on a number of state of the art models on the same (as well as augmented) dataset.
## **Code**
All code in this repository is based on the following PyTorch sources:
1. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html
